     * A positive integer N is given. The goal is to find the highest power of 2 that divides N. In other words, we have to find the maximum K for which N modulo 2^K is 0.
     * <p>
     * For example, given integer N = 24 the answer is 3, because 2^3 = 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides N.
     * <p>
     * Write a function:
     * <p>
     * class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
     * <p>
     * that, given a positive integer N, returns the highest power of 2 that divides N.
     * <p>
     * For example, given integer N = 24, the function should return 3, as explained above.
     * <p>
     * Assume that:
     * <p>
     * N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
     * In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
